# File Tracker React Prototype

This is a React - Flux application that serves as a prototype for a project I am working on at my job.
I used this project as an opportunity to learn modern React (mid-2018), JSX, and the flux pattern.
I am simulating a database with a set of JSON files and functions that return subsets of them.
Most of the animations in the app are CSS animations. There is one using ReactCSSTransitionGroup.
Work is ongoing.
